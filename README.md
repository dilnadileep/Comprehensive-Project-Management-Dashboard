# Comprehensive-Project-Management-Dashboard
---

### **1. Plan the Folder Structure**
 structure:  
- **Core**: Services, guards, interceptors, models.  
- **Features**: Separate modules for login, dashboard, projects, tasks, and team members.  
- **Shared**: Reusable components (modals, buttons), directives, and pipes.  

---

### **2. Step-by-Step Implementation**
#### **a. Login Page**
- **Objective**: Authenticate users and restrict access to the dashboard.  
- **Key Concepts**: Reactive forms, validation, and route guards.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. A `login` module with a login component.  
  2. Reactive form with validators for username and password.  
  3.  A service (`AuthService`) to validate credentials.  
  4. A guard (`AuthGuard`) to restrict access to the dashboard.  

---

#### **b. Dashboard Page**
- **Objective**: Central hub for navigation and data visualization.  
- **Key Concepts**: Routing, lazy loading, D3.js for visualization.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Set up child routes for `projects`, `tasks`, and `team-members`.  
  2. A bar chart (D3.js) to visualize task completion per project.

---

#### **c. Add Project**
- **Objective**: Allow users to create projects.  
- **Key Concepts**: Forms, modals, services.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. A reusable `ModalComponent` in the `shared` folder.  
  2. A form with fields for project name, description, and deadline.  
  3. Save project data using a service and display it in a table.

---

#### **d. Task List**
- **Objective**: Manage tasks and associate them with projects.  
- **Key Concepts**: Forms, table components, filtering, and sorting.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. A reusable table component for tasks.  
  2. Add task form with dropdowns for projects and team members.  
  3. Implement filters (pipes) and sorting for tasks.  

---

#### **e. Edit and Delete Tasks**
- **Objective**: Modify or remove tasks.  
- **Key Concepts**: Two-way binding, confirmation dialogs.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Use modals for editing tasks.  
  2. A service method to update or delete tasks.  
  3. Use `confirm()` or a custom dialog for deletion.

---

#### **f. Team Members Section**
- **Objective**: Manage and assign team members.  
- **Key Concepts**: Tables, dropdowns, and services.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. A table for listing team members.  
  2. Allow assignment to projects/tasks using dropdowns.  

---

#### **g. Data Visualization**
- **Objective**: Use D3.js for insights into task data.  
- **Key Concepts**: Data-driven documents, charts.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. A bar chart in the dashboard using D3.js.  
  2. Bind task data dynamically to visualize completion status.

---

#### **h. Routing and Guards**
- **Objective**: Navigate and secure routes.  
- **Key Concepts**: Guards, lazy loading.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Create routes for all modules and lazy load them.  
  2. Protect routes with `AuthGuard`.  

---

#### **i. JSON Server**
- **Objective**: Simulate APIs for data storage and retrieval.  
- **Key Concepts**: Observables, interceptors.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Set up JSON Server with endpoints for users, projects, tasks, and team members.  
  2.  HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in your services.  
  3. Handle errors with an interceptor.

---

### **3. Technologies and Tools**
- **Angular Concepts**: Use observables for reactive data handling and interceptors for API interactions.  
- **D3.js**: Integrate charts dynamically in the dashboard.  
- **JSON Server**: Fake API for seamless testing.  

---

### **4. Final Notes**
- **Documentation**: Add comments to your code for better readability.  
- **Interfaces**: Use TypeScript interfaces for strong typing.  
- **Styling**: Use SCSS for a professional design.
